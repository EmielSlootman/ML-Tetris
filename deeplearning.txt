In this document we will have a overview of reinforcement learning and deeplearning to have a better knowlage what it is and how to use it.
This will be done with some links and short discriptions what is in those links.

First overview. If it isn't clear what is reinforcement learning and deeplearning
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning

Helpfull youtube movies that can help to get a good overview.

an overview of the different neural network structrures that are there and there advantages.
It is not very usefull for us.

tetris (code1)
This algorithm uses a reinforcement learning technique to learn how to play Tetris. 
It developed a policy on how to select the best action based upon four features of the board:
aggregate height, unevenness, maximum height, and number of holes.
 It performed stochastic gradient ascent to achieve the highest score, and quickly outpaced my own efforts.
 Eventually, since the score is incremented by the square of the number of lines clear,
 it even learned to clear multiple lines at once!
